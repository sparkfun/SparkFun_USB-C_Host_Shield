## Headers
The pins for the USB Host Shield are broken out to 0.1"-spaced pins on the outer edges of the board. When selecting headers, be sure you are aware of the functionality you need. The [Arduino Stackable Header Kit - R3](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11417) is a great option as it allows users to stack shields (*w/ Uno/R3 footprint*); with the pins still accessible through the female headers.

## USB Device
The USB port is utilized for the host/peripheral interface. Users only need to connect a USB device or connect their USB Host Shield to a computer, using a USB-C cable.
