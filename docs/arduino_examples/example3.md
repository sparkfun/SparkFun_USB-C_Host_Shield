## XBOX One Controller
In this example, we will be utilizing the [XBOXONE](https://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield_2.0/tree/master/examples/Xbox/XBOXONE) example from the [USB_Host_Shield_2.0 Arduino library](https://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield_2.0). This example can be found in the File dropdown menu _(i.e. **File** > **Examples** > **USB Host Shield Library 2.0** > **Xbox** > **XBOXONE**)_. Once the example has been opened, users should see the `XBOXONE.ino` example sketch.

Users will need to connect an XBox One controller to the USB-C connector before running the example. After the example executes, users should see an output in the [Serial Monitor](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/112) with print out based on the user's interaction with their contoller.
